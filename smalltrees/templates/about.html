  <dt><b>Scope</b></dt><dd>  
  <P>
  This website presents an algebraic classification of small tree and network models in phylogenetics. It currently hosts data on twentysix trees, paired with five different model types. These are listed in the table on the landing page. Mathematical details can be found on individual subpages for each tree and model.

  We focus on providing thorough computational proof for every result. To achieve this, the website is supplemented by the <a href="https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/Experimental/AlgebraicStatistics/phylogenetics/">AlgebraicPhylogenetics.jl</a> software. The code is part of the <a href="https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/Experimental/AlgebraicStatistics">AlgebraicStatistics.jl</a> package in the <a href="https://docs.oscar-system.org">OSCAR project</a>, written in <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>.

  The page <a href="/notation">Notions and notation</a> gives a mathematical introduction to the topic, and presents code snippets in a running example. You can download all our data under this <a href="#">link</a>, in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-64529-7_25">.mrdi</a> format.
